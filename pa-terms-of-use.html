    <h1>Pixel Art. Terms Of Use.</h1>

    <p>
        The following terms and conditions (the “Agreement”) govern all use of the “Roman Kotov” mobile application for my Pixel Art (“App”) and the website located at https://rkweb-3b99e.web.app/ (“Website” and, collectively, the “Service”). The Service is provided to you by Roman Kotov. (“Roman Kotov”, “us”, “we, or “our”). The Service is subject to your (“you” or “your”) acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein. By using the Services in any way, you agree to these terms. This Agreement includes any policies we post on in the App or on the Website. Special features provided by Roman Kotov may be subject to different or additional terms or conditions. To the extent they conflict with this Agreement, such different or additional terms and conditions will control.

        Roman Kotov reserves the right to modify or replace any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement at any time. Roman Kotov will notify users a notice posted on the App or Website. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.

        You hereby certify to Roman Kotov that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). You also certify that you are otherwise legally permitted to use the Service. If you’re agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in this Agreement, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).

    <h4>Fees</h4>
    <p>
        The Services are currently free; however, certain products and services available through the App or Website may have associated fees. If you purchase any such products or services, you hereby authorize Roman Kotov and its Third Party Provider (for payments) to charge your credit card for such payment(s).

        Additionally, if you choose to enroll in our subscription program, you will be charged a monthly or annual subscription fee depending on the option you select upon enrollment (“Subscription Fee”). The Subscription Fee will be charged to you in advance, either through the in-app purchase functionality (if available) or to the credit card you provided upon enrollment, and you hereby authorize Roman Kotov and its Third Party Provider (for payments) to charge your payment method for such payment(s). Subscription Fees are non-refundable. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, any subscription Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. If you terminate a subscription Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.

        You will ensure that your payment details (such as your credit card number) are accurate and up-to-date at all times.
